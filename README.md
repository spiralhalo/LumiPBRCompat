# Lumi PBR Compat
Lumi PBR materials for 3rd party stuff.

[Lumi Lights](https://github.com/spiralhalo/LumiLightsPBR) is a shader pack for [Canvas renderer](https://github.com/grondag/canvas) mod for Minecraft on the Fabric mod platform.

Currently adds PBR materials for [Tech Reborn](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/techreborn). See [releases](https://github.com/spiralhalo/LumiPBRCompat/releases) for more details.

**[REQUIRES LUMI PBR](https://github.com/spiralhalo/LumiLightsPBR)**

**[REQUIRES LUMI PBR EXT](https://github.com/spiralhalo/LumiPBRExt)**

Compat typically adds redundancies from Ext for complex material maps. It's advised to put Compat above Ext in the resource pack list otherwise some things like **armors** wouldn't work.
